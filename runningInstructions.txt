I have been able to attempt all parts of the coursework that was mandatory so as to produce a fully working simulation
of the Beehive as per the specification.
The Java source code contains two methods that can be used to start the simulation. But i have chosen 
to accept the config file through the command line which was required as part of the Extension section.
They are: readSimulationConfig() and inputConfigValues()
Note that in the main() method, readSimulationConfig() is commented out. So if you want to test it, kindly 
comment out the inputConfigValues() to do so.
The program does not require the simconfig.txt to be created manually before execution, it will do so as you input values
through the command line.
For the configuration values, there are limits(neither of these values can be negative):
-Simulation days cannot exceed 500
-Worker bees cannot exceed 250
-Honey cannot exceed 20000 units

**There are comments throughout the program to improve readability.
